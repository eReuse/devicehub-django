<h1>Device Donation Agreement</h1>
<h2>Between {{ donor.name }} and {{ circuit_manager.user.first_name }}</h2>
<p>In {{ agreement.place }}, on {{ agreement.date }}</p>
<p>On one part, {{ donor.name }}, located at {{ donor.address }},
represented herein by {{ donor.representative }}, hereinafter referred
to as the DONOR.</p>
<p>On the other part, {{ circuit_manager.user.first_name }}, located at {{ circuit_manager.address }}, represented herein by {{ circuit_manager.representative }}, hereinafter referred to as the
DONEE.</p>
<p>Both parties, acting in exercise of their respective positions,
declare and state that they intervene in this agreement with the
necessary legal capacity and sufficient competence to subscribe to
it.</p>
<h2 id="background">BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>I. {{ circuit_manager.user.first_name }} is an association established in {{ circuit_manager.established_in }} aiming to provide Internet and new
information and communication technologies (ICT) to associations, NGOs,
individuals, and non-profit groups working towards change, education,
peace, environment, development, cooperation, and social justice.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>{{ circuit_manager.user.first_name }} participates in the eReuse.org collective
management community where participants exchange common resources to
encourage the reuse, traceability, and final recycling of digital
devices such as computers, laptops, or mobile phones.</li>
</ol>
<p>Participants federate and implement locally managed reuse circuits.
In {{ circuit_manager.location }}, the {{ circuit_manager.user.first_name }} has been
created, an open and voluntary circuit, democratically managed where
participating agents are ESS initiatives creating a common space to
facilitate the donation, collection, refurbishment, and local
distribution of digital devices.</p>
<p>The circuits use eReuse’s free software and distributed services to
scale, certify processes, and trace digital devices through multiple
cycles of reuse until final recycling.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>The DONEE, {{ circuit_manager.user.first_name }}, is interested in the donation
of hardware for the fulfillment of public and social interest purposes
indicated above.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="statements">STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>The DONEE is an independent non-profit organization that promotes the
strategic use of communication networks and ICTs for development and
social justice and wishes to facilitate the reuse of hardware by
non-profit entities with a social purpose.</p>
<p>The DONOR directly owns a range of computer equipment that it has
previously used for the operation of its services and activities. These
are economically amortized equipment with no possibility of use by it,
and therefore are considered obsolete and are no longer in use by the
DONOR.</p>
<p>The DONEE is interested in the donation of equipment for the
fulfillment of public and social interest purposes indicated above.</p>
<p>Both parties declare and acknowledge that there is no exclusivity
obligation between them.</p>
<p>In light of the above and given the complementarity and coincidence
of their purposes, both parties agree to sign this donation agreement,
which shall be governed by the following:</p>
<h2 id="clauses">CLAUSES</h2>
<h3 id="first-purpose">First — Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this agreement is the donation by the DONOR of all
their rights and titles relating to the obsolete and unused hardware to
the DONEE, who accepts it for the fulfillment of the purposes indicated
and acknowledges that it has no accounting value.</p>
<p>The DONEE will channel the decommissioned hardware to the
collaborating entities, which will refurbish and distribute it to the
receiving entities. The terms and conditions used in the selection of
collaborating and receiving entities, all of which are non-profit, are
defined in Sub Annex 1 and in the third clause.</p>
<p>In the event that the DONOR wishes to make a donation to the DONEE of
other computer equipment in the future, such new donation will be
governed by the provisions of this agreement while it remains in effect.
For this, subsequent annexes may be signed (see Sub Annex 2).</p>
<h3 id="second-conditions-of-the-donations">Second — Conditions of the
donations</h3>
<p>2.1 The DONEE commits to fulfill all of the DONOR’s obligations in
relation to the hardware and its use and to notify its final
destination, which may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. The hardware will be channeled to collaborating entities for
refurbishment and distributed to receiving entities.</li>
<li>B. Hardware found to be unsuitable for distribution will be
appropriately recycled by authorized agents, preferably those
established in Clause Three.</li>
<li>C. The DONEE shall not, under any circumstances, use the donated
hardware for commercial purposes, although it may be given in use (in
usufruct) to receiving entities in exchange for economic compensation
aimed at covering circularity costs, complying with section 2.2(E).</li>
</ul>
<p>2.2 The DONEE commits to perform all acts and manage to ensure
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Collaborating entities prioritize reuse, repair, and preparation
for reuse in recycling.</li>
<li>B. Receiving entities extend the useful life of the hardware and,
when obsolete and there is no more demand for reuse, take it to an
authorized recycling point.</li>
<li>C. Collaborating and receiving entities clearly and visibly indicate
that the hardware provided comes from {{ donor.name }} for the
appropriate social purpose, and may state in dissemination materials
that the devices come from collaboration with {{ donor.name }}. The
equipment may only be given in use when:
<ul>
<li>The amount of the use donation shall not exceed the cost of
circularity services (transport, storage, inventory management,
refurbishment, spare parts, distribution).</li>
<li>Preference is always given to priority groups, and conditions
specified in Clause Three.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>D. The DONEE may receive voluntary monetary donations from
collaborators to sustain circuit coordination; no discrimination may
occur for non-donation. The DONEE commits to transparency with the DONOR
about these donations.</li>
<li>E. The DONEE commits to transparency with the DONOR regarding
amounts billed to receiving entities for the use donation (circularity
costs).</li>
<li>F. The DONEE commits to send a social impact report to the DONOR no
later than one year from the donation of the devices.</li>
<li>G. Regarding collections, the DONEE ensures:
<ul>
<li>H. Prior to collection, the DONOR must send an Inventory note with
details of hardware (Appendix 1A).
<ul>
<li>I. Hardware to be collected must be centralized.</li>
<li><ol start="2" type="I">
<li>At least 10 items including laptops and personal computers.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="I">
<li>With the inventory note, the DONEE seeks a collaborating entity
willing to collect.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" type="I">
<li>If accepted, the DONEE refers it to a collaborator who collects
everything.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>V. If not accepted, the DONEE informs the DONOR what actions are
needed to make the collection acceptable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2.3 Data wipe will be carried out by the DONOR, adopting security
measures to comply with applicable data protection regulations,
including: - Organic Law 3/2018 (Spain). - Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(GDPR).</p>
<p>2.4 At the time of the donation, the DONOR allows the DONEE to donate
the hardware to collaborating entities; this can be carried out at the
DONOR’s facilities and does not require the physical presence of the
DONEE.</p>
<p>2.5 The DONOR will complete Appendix 1A and, before donation,
formalize the declaration of the devices as unusable goods and their
removal from the DONOR’s inventory note.</p>
<h3 id="third-conditions-of-destination-allocation">Third — Conditions
of destination / allocation</h3>
<p>3.1 The DONEE commits to fulfill all of the DONOR’s obligations in
relation to the hardware and its use and to notify its final
destination, which may be: - A. Refurbished and distributed for reuse
via collaborating entities. - B. Recycled by authorized agents if
unsuitable for reuse. - C. Granted in use (usufruct) to receiving
entities consistent with circularity cost requirements.</p>
<p>3.2 The receivers are the entities designated to receive reusable
hardware. Receivers must primarily be social interest groups, including
cooperatives, foundations, associations, non-profit entities and
networks, social services facilities, vulnerable families or
individuals, or families with minors in school lacking adequate
equipment.</p>
<p>3.3 Collaborating entities maintain a needs list; order of arrival
determines priority. If within one month after collection there are no
pending needs and no new requests from priority groups, hardware may be
allocated to the general public, provided refurbishment/distribution
costs are within 80–120 EUR. Priority groups always take precedence.</p>
<p>3.4 The DONEE will monitor selection conditions and report to the
oversight committee of Clause Six.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-certificates">Fourth — Certificates</h3>

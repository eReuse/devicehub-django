<h2 class="h2"><strong>DEVICE DONATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN {{ object.name }} AND THE {{ circuit_manager.first_name }}</strong></h2>


<p>In [&nbsp; ], on [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>On one part,&nbsp; {{ object.name }}, located at {{ object.address }}, represented herein by {{ donor.representable }}, hereinafter referred to as the DONOR.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On the other part, the {{ circuit_manager.name }}, located at {{ circuit_manager.address }} represented herein by {{ circuit_manager.representative }}, hereinafter referred to as the DONEE.</p>


<p>Both parties, acting in exercise of their respective positions, declare and state that they intervene in this agreement with the necessary legal capacity and sufficient competence to subscribe to it.</p>


<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>


<p>I. {{ circuit_manager.name }} is an association established in {{ circuit_manager.address }} aiming to provide Internet and new information and communication technologies (ICT) to associations, NGOs, individuals, and non-profit groups working towards change, education, peace, environment, development, cooperation, and social justice.&nbsp;</p>


<p>II. {{ circuit_manager.name }} participates in the eReuse.org, a collective management community where participants exchange common resources to encourage the reuse, traceability, and final recycling of digital devices such as computers, laptops, or mobile phones. In eReuse.org,&nbsp; the community develops, maintains, and improves common resources in an open and free format; resources and distributed services aimed at extending the lifespan of devices and ensuring their recycling at the end of their useful life. Participants federate and implement locally managed reuse circuits. In [LOCATION], the {{ circuit_manager.name }} has been created, an open and voluntary circuit, democratically managed where participating agents are ESS initiatives creating a common space to facilitate the donation, collection, refurbishment, and local distribution of digital devices. The circuits use eReuse&#8217;s free software and distributed services to scale, certify processes, and trace digital devices through multiple cycles of reuse until final recycling. The circuit participants have agreed on a general license containing fundamental principles, definitions, and usage conditions that serve as inspiration in case of any doubt regarding the interpretation of the license.</p>



<p>III. The DONEE, {{ circuit_manager.name }}, is interested in the donation of hardware for the fulfillment of public and social interest purposes indicated in the first and second paragraphs</p>



<p><strong>STATEMENTS</strong></p>



<p>The DONEE is an independent non-profit organization that promotes the strategic use of communication networks and ICTs for development and social justice and wishes to facilitate the reuse of hardware by non-profit entities with a social purpose</p>



<p>The DONOR directly owns a range of computer equipment that it has previously used for the operation of its services and activities. These are economically amortized equipment with no possibility of use by it, and therefore, are considered obsolete, and are no longer in use by the DONOR.</p>



<p>The DONEE is interested in the donation of equipment for the fulfillment of public and social interest purposes indicated in the first paragraph.</p>



<p>Both parties declare and acknowledge that there is no exclusivity obligation between them.</p>



<p>In light of the above and given the complementarity and coincidence of their purposes, both parties, recognizing each other the necessary legal capacity to bind in representation of their respective entities, agree to sign this donation agreement, which shall be governed by the following:</p>



<p><strong>CLAUSES</strong></p>



<p><strong>First,-Purpose</strong></p>



<p>The purpose of this agreement is the donation by the DONOR of all their rights and titles relating to the obsolete and unused hardware to the DONEE, who accepts it for the fulfilment of the purposes indicated and acknowledges that it has no accounting value.</p>



<p>The DONEE will channel the decommissioned hardware to the collaborating entities, which will refurbish and distribute it to the receiving entities. The terms and conditions used in the selection of collaborating and receiving entities, all of which are non-profit, are defined in a specific document, which can be consulted in Sub Annex 1 and in the third clause, and which have been established democratically in the collaborative platform agreements and commitments of {{ circuit_manager.name }}.</p>



<p>In the event that the DONOR wishes to make a donation to the DONEE of other computer equipment in the future, such new donation will be governed by the provisions of this agreement while it remains in effect. For this, subsequent annexes may be signed (see Sub Annex 2) under the auspices of this agreement.</p>



<p><strong>Second,- Conditions of the donations:</strong></p>



<p>2.1 The DONEE commits to fulfill all of the DONOR&#8217;s obligations in relation to the hardware and its use and to notify its final destination, which may be:</p>



<ul>
<li>A. The hardware will be channeled to collaborating entities for refurbishment and distributed to receiving entities. Both the collaborating and receiving entities are specified in Clause Three.</li>



<li>B. Hardware that is provided to collaborating entities and found to be unsuitable for distribution, either because it cannot be repaired or lacks demand from the receiving entities  will be appropriately recycled by agents authorized by the competent authorities, preferably those established in Clause Three.</li>



<li>C. The DONEE shall not, under any circumstances, use the donated hardware for commercial purposes, although it may be given in use (in usufruct) to the receiving entities in exchange for economic compensation aimed at covering the costs of circularity, complying with the requirements stated in section 2.2(E). </li>
</ul>



<p>2.2 The DONEE commits to perform all acts and manage to ensure that:</p>



<ul>
<li>A. Collaborating entities prioritize the reuse, repair, and preparation for reuse in recycling.</li>



<li>B. Receiving entities extend the useful life of the hardware and, when the hardware becomes obsolete and there is no more demand for reuse, take it to an authorized recycling point.</li>



<li>C. Collaborating and receiving entities clearly and visibly indicate that the hardware provided comes from [DONOR NAME] for the appropriate social purpose, as well as to state in dissemination materials that the devices come from the collaboration with [DONOR NAME]. The equipment may only be given in use when the following two conditions are met:
<ul>
<li>The amount of the use donation of the computer equipment shall not exceed, under any circumstances, the cost of the following services necessary to recirculate a good (circularity costs): transport, storage, inventory management, refurbishment, spare parts, and distribution.</li>



<li>Preference is always given to entities or groups of interest or priority, and conditions specified in the Clause Three of this agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>D. The DONEE may receive monetary donations from collaborators to make economically sustainable the coordination of the collaborative platform circuit and the tasks that arise such as the coordination of collections, hardware monitoring, and report generation with the DONOR. Donations from collaborating entities must be entirely voluntary. Under no circumstances can the non-formalization of donations to the DONEE entail any type of discrimination by the collaborating entities. The DONEE commits to being transparent with the DONOR about the monetary donations received from the collaborating entities for circuit management</li>



<li>E. The DONEE commits to being transparent with the DONOR regarding the amounts that the collaborating entities have billed to the receiving entities for the use donation and in accordance with circularity costs.</li>



<li>F. The DONEE commits to send a social impact report of the devices to the DONOR no later than one year from the donation of the devices.</li>



<li>G. Regarding collections, the DONEE ensures:</li>



<li>H. Prior to the collection, the DONOR must send an Inventory note  with the details of the hardware given to the DONEE (See Appendix 1A).
<ul>
<li>I. The hardware to be collected must be at a centralized point.</li>



<li>II. There must be at least 10 items including laptops and personal computers.</li>



<li>III. With the inventory note, the DONEE looks for a collaborating entity that wants to carry out the collection. This entity will have assessed whether it is worthwhile to collect all the material. </li>



<li>IV. In case of acceptance of the collection, the DONEE refers it to a collaborator, and they collect everything</li>



<li>V. In case of non-acceptance of the collection, the DONEE informs the DONOR of what actions should be taken to make the collection acceptable, trying to ensure that non-acceptance is exceptional.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>2.3 Data wipe will be carried out by the DONOR, adopting and implementing the security measures necessary to comply with applicable data protection regulations. For the specific case of the Pangea circuit, this includes compliance with the following regulations: </p>



<ul>
<li>Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on the protection of personal data and guarantee of digital rights (Spain).</li>



<li>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 27 April 2016, relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (DOUE 4.5.2016).</li>
</ul>



<p>2.4 At the time of the donation of goods, the DONOR allows the DONEE to donate the hardware to collaborating entities, and this donation can be carried out in the same facilities of the DONOR and does not require the physical presence of the DONEE.</p>



<p>2.5 The DONOR will complete Appendix 1A  to comply with the obligations related to the delivery of the devices. Before proceeding with the donation of the computer equipment, the DONOR must formalize two declarations: the declaration of the devices as unusable goods and the consequent removal from the DONOR&#8217;s Inventory note.</p>



<p><strong>Thirth,- Conditions of the donations:</strong></p>



<p>3.1 The DONEE commits to fulfill all of the DONOR&#8217;s obligations in relation to the hardware and its use and to notify its final destination, which may be:</p>



<p>3.2 The receivers are the entities designated to receive the reusable hardware. The receivers must primarily be social interest groups, which we define as: cooperatives, foundations, associations, and nonprofit entities, including federations, confederations, coordinators, and networks composed of cooperatives or non-profit associations, as well as public or private facilities accompanied by social services, families referred by the Education Consortium, individuals or families in vulnerable situations, or families with minors in school who do not have adequate computer equipment for school learning.</p>



<p>3.3 The collaborating entities will create a list to record the needs of the participating receivers entities as they arise; the order of arrival of requests will determine the priority in case of available hardware or upon the arrival of new donations. If within a month, counting from the day following the collection by the collaborating entity, the list does not contain pending needs or there have been no new requests from the groups mentioned in the previous paragraph, the hardware may be allocated to the general public, provided that the costs of refurbishment and distribution are within the range of eighty to one hundred twenty euros. In any case, when the demand comes from a priority entity or group specified in point 3.2, it will take precedence over the general public.</p>
